## **JSGoL** \(**J**ava**S**cript **G**ame **o**f **L**ife\), is a simple Conway's Game Of Life (cellular automaton) web app.

- [x] Responsive :
      It's (almost) responsive, and works pretty well without needing to own a Mac:
      just use the buttons on your left side (or on your top, depending if you're on phone or not).
- [x] It's lightweight
- [x] It's pretty intuitive: draw your "cells", clear the "canvas", change its size, clean it...
- [ ] Please note the code is not really optimized, since I've finished th v1 months ago (right now I'm sure I wouldn't totally "clone" it).

### Feel free to use it/improve it, just fork!


**Releases**: 

- Version 2: Performances improvment: instead of ~130ms for a 512 x 512 randomization loop , it takes now ~65ms. (But could eat your CPU...) 
             It also adds some graphical improvments, like svg icons (network performance, modern look at least...), and a minimizer button if you don't like text. 

- Version 1: Initial release.

**Plans for future versions**

- A zoom and navigate option \(Like in Maps....\), because honestly right now it feels a bit "static" 
- Known GoL patterns drawing tool
- Maybe some new performance tricks.
- And some playback features like step-by-step (I'm not even sure that there's an issue somewhere :/ )
