**JSGoL** \(**J**ava**S**cript **G**ame **o**f **L**ife\), is simple Conway's Game Of LIfe (cellular automaton) web app.

It's (almost) responsive, and works pretty well.
Please note the code is not really optimized, since I've finished months ago (right now I'm sure I wouldn't totally "clone" it).
Feel free to use it/improve it, just fork!
