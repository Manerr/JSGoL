## **JSGoL** \(**J**ava**S**cript **G**ame **o**f **L**ife\), is a simple Conway's Game Of Life (cellular automaton) web app.

- [x] Responsive :
      It's (almost) responsive, and works pretty well without needing to own a Mac:
      just use the buttons on your left side (on on your top, depending if you're on phone or not).
- [x] It's lightweight
- [x] It's pretty intuitive: draw your "cells", clear the "canvas", change its size, clean it...
- [ ] Please note the code is not really optimized, since I've finished months ago (right now I'm sure I wouldn't totally "clone" it).
