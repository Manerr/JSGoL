**JSGoL** \(**J**ava**S**cript **G**ame **o**f **L**ife\), is a simple Conway's Game Of Life (cellular automaton) web app.

- [x] It's (almost) responsive, and works pretty well: just use the buttons on your left side (on on your top, depending if you're on phone or not).
- [x] It's lightweight.
- [ ]  Please note the code is not really optimized, since I've finished months ago (right now I'm sure I wouldn't totally "clone" it).

Feel free to use it/improve it, just fork!
